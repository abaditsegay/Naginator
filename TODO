Remove the hard-coding of 'nagios' as the nagios user.

Remove most other hard-coding stuff.

Default to creating 'local-service' and 'remote-service'

Fix all cfengine scripts so they actually do all of the necessary work (they
currently don't run nagconfig, for instance).

Document enhost and facter so they can be easily used here.
