These configurations are not guaranteed to be current.  They are based on my
running configuration, but I am not exactly prompt about copying them over.

Please email me directly (luke AT madstop.com) if you think they should be
updated.

There are two important things to know about these files:
	1) They provide for _two_ running nagios processes, one against centralnagios.cfg
	and the other against localnagios.cfg
	2) They are interprted by the module:nagios script and used to create the
	generated, aggregated configuration file.
